## [Login Microservice PRD](<>)


### Overview


## The login microservice is a simple and efficient microservice that provides [user authentication](<>) and authorization.


### Features and Requirements


## The microservice should implement the following core features:
- [User registration](<>): The microservice should allow new users to create an account and store their information in the database.
- [User](<>) authentication: The microservice should provide a secure and reliable method for authenticating users using [JWT](<>).
- [Password reset](<>): The microservice should allow users to reset their password if they forget it or need to change it.
- Security: The microservice should implement appropriate security measures, such as encryption and access control, to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.


### [Technology Stack](<>)


## The login microservice will be implemented using the following technologies:
- [Java](<>): Programming language
- [Spring Boot](<>): Framework for building microservices
- [Spring Security](<>): [Security framework](<>) for Java
- JWT (JSON [Web Tokens](<>)): Token-based [authentication mechanism](<>)
- [Hibernate](<>): Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for Java
- [MySQL](<>): [Relational database management](<>) system
- [Gradle](<>) or [Maven](<>): Build tools for Java
- RabbitMQ: [Message queue technology](<>) for asynchronous processing of login and [authentication requests](<>)


### User Interface
The login microservice will have a simple user interface that allows users to register, log in, and reset their password.

### [API](<>) and Integration
The [login microservice API](<>) will use [RESTful endpoints](<>) and [JSON data](<>) format. The microservice will integrate with other systems using HTTP or [HTTPS protocols](<>).


### Testing and [Quality Assurance](<>)
The login microservice will undergo [unit testing](<>) and [integration testing](<>) to ensure that it meets the functional and non-functional requirements. The microservice will also undergo security testing to identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.


### Deployment and Maintenance
The login microservice will be deployed using Docker containers and managed using [Kubernetes](<>). The microservice will be monitored for performance and availability using monitoring tools like [Prometheus](<>) and [Grafana](<>). Security patches and updates will be applied regularly to ensure the microservice is secure and up-to-date.By using RabbitMQ as the [message broker](<>), the login microservice can process login and authentication requests asynchronously, improve scalability and performance, and ensure that the microservice meets the requirements for user authentication and authorization.
